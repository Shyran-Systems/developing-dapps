#Purpose

## What it is for

While this book can act as an introduction to building decentralized applications, its primary purpose is to highlight the different kinds of √êApps and how best to develop them for greater compatibility in the ecosystem.

## And what it's not

This book does not go into detail about the creation of smart contracts. While we do cover some simple examples for demonstration purposes, these will be superficial in most cases.
